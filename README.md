# pytorch-resnet-twitch
PyTorch implementation(s) of various ResNet models from Twitch streams.

**Status:** Code broken, going to come back and look how to add ConvNeXt (https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt) features to ResNet50

ResNet50 currently not working. Will update in next stream. Tried and failed to get it working in the first stream. We'll get it next time.
